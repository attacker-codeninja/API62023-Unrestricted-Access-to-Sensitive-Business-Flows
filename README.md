# API62023-Unrestricted-Access-to-Sensitive-Business-Flows
This repository contains a secure Python API script built to mitigate the risk of "Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows" (API6:2023). The script implements rate limiting, authentication, and other security measures to ensure that only legitimate clients can access sensitive business flows, such as buying a ticket or posting a comment, without causing harm to the business.
Features

    Rate Limiting: The API enforces rate limiting to prevent excessive automated usage. Each API key is allowed 100 requests per minute.

    Request Authentication and Authorization: Clients need to provide valid API keys and secrets to access the API. Additionally, the API verifies whether the client has the necessary permissions to access specific endpoints.

    Logging and Error Handling: The API logs important events, errors, and API usage information. Errors are handled gracefully, and meaningful error messages are provided to clients.

    Caching for Read-Only Endpoints: For endpoints that provide read-only data (e.g., retrieving comments), caching is implemented to improve performance and reduce the load on the database or backend systems.

    Response Formatting and Versioning: API responses are consistently formatted using JSON. The API versioning mechanism is implemented to handle changes without breaking existing clients.

Installation and Setup

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-script.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to set up the necessary environment variables:

    Rename the .env.example file to .env.

    Open the .env file and fill in the required values for API keys, secrets, and other configuration variables.

Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

bash

python api/app.py

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/.
API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

    POST /buy_ticket: API endpoint to buy a ticket.
    POST /post_comment: API endpoint to post a comment.

Rate Limiting and Security

This API has been designed to mitigate the risk of "Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows" (API6:2023) by enforcing rate limiting and ensuring secure access only to authorized clients. It is intended to safeguard sensitive business flows from harmful automated usage, providing a secure and reliable API service.
